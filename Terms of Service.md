# Terms of Service for Auth Guard

**Effective Date:** February 1, 2026

By authorizing **Auth Guard** or joining a server protected by this bot, you agree to the following terms:

### 1. Acceptance of Terms
By clicking "Authorize," you grant Auth Guard permission to access your basic identity and the ability to add your account to servers. If you do not agree, do not authorize the application.

### 2. User Requirements
To pass verification, users must comply with the automated security checks, which include:
* **Account Age:** Accounts must be at least 10 days old.
* **Integrity:** Users must not attempt to bypass checks using VPNs, proxies, disposable emails, or incognito mode.
* **MFA:** Multi-Factor Authentication must be enabled if the destination server requires it.

### 3. Verification Limits
* Users are permitted a maximum of **5 verification attempts**. 
* Exceeding this limit may result in an automatic permanent ban from the protected server.

### 4. Server Backup & Auto-Join
You acknowledge that by authorizing this bot, the bot developer may "pull" your account into a new/backup Discord server if the original server is deleted, raided, or moved. This is a redundancy feature for community continuity.

### 5. Prohibited Conduct
You agree not to:
* Attempt to reverse-engineer the bot's security logic.
* Use the bot to facilitate raids or malicious activity.
* Spam the verification commands or buttons.

### 6. Disclaimer of Liability
**Auth Guard** is provided "as is." The developers are not responsible for any lost data, server deletions, or Discord TOS violations resulting from the use of this tool. Use at your own risk.

### 7. Termination
We reserve the right to revoke your verification status or ban your ID from the service at any time, for any reason, without notice.
